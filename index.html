      <h1>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1>

      <small><p> Dear Eileen, </p>
      <br>
      <p> Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.
      </p>   </small>
      <h2>Starting dates</h2>
      <small>
      <p>  We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you </p>
      <p>could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>  First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
      <li>   Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
      <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
      </ul>


      <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
      <br>
      <p>You can find more information about <a href="https://www.google.lt/">important university dates</a>  on our website.</p>
      </small>


      <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
      <small> <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility â€” as long as the subjects fall</p>
      <p>somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just</p>
      <p>the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued</p>
      <p>by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>

      <ol>
      <li>Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C14H12O3.)</li>
      <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30oC (86oF), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 103 increasing to 3 x 104.)</li>
      <li> <abbr title="Suniukas">HTML</abbr>  and <abbr title="katukas">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the </p>
      <p>research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>

      <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
      <small>
      <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question,</p>
      <p> my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>
      <br>
      <p>Polynesian chicken dance</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 40px">
      A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300<abbr title="because">BC</abbr>, a whole village would dance around   </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 40px"> in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful".</p>

      <p> Icelandic brownian shuffle</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 40px">  Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 40px">   involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptably
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 40px">
      tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 40px">
      modern styles such as Twerking.
      </p>
      <p>Arctic robot dance</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 40px">
      An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 40px">
      discovered a new dance style characterised by inhabitants
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 40px">
      of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 40px">
      because they were really cold.
      </p>
      <br>

      <br>
      <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
      <br>
